[Magic I Want U & How to Teleport by Jane Remover](https://cider.sh/share/album/l.LLDO7wv)

I'm not gonna lie y'all... initially when these songs came out I was kinda sleeping on them but like... they greeeew on me I love them now.

[Heart Out by The 1975](https://cider.sh/share/song/1440819283)

me and [Wyatt](https://gb.opn.haus) were VCing and we were clicking through the 1975 stuff and we ended up talking about their debut album and I was like "I don't really remember anything" and then he clicked on this song and like OOOOOOH right.... love this one its fun

[Gone by Charli xcx](https://cider.sh/share/song/1468263363)

[Night/Day/Work/Home by CFCF](https://cider.sh/share/song/1552749595) & [Punksong by CFCF](https://cider.sh/share/song/1552749591) & [Self Service 1999 by CFCF](https://cider.sh/share/song/1552749605) & [After the After by CFCF](https://cider.sh/share/song/1552749789)

OOOOOkay... again, in another gusic vc and I said something like "I listened to memoryland..... I don't remember anything". they started playing these tracks and I was like ughhh yess wait I'm so dumb... like sometimes for a song to hit you just need to hear it through Discord Screenshare.

[Challengers (2024) [Rewatch]](https://letterboxd.com/air2earth/film/challengers/1/)

Yessss finally got around to rewatching this with my oomf [Wyatt](https://gb.opn.haus)! Watched it on the Blu-Ray I have of it and UGH I still fucking LOVE this movie.

One thing I will say however... it hits waaaaay harder in theaters. Which is sorta disappointing, but I'm sure you can recreate that atmosphere by just... listening with speakers and not with headphones.

## <span style="color: #ff4930">TV</span>

nothing really

## <span class="npf_color_monica">Games</span>

same old same old.. also been playing lots of IIDX at home, super fun!

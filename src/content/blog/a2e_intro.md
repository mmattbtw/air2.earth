# welcome to air2.earth!

this is a new site meant to be a companion to my personal website. I'm starting this because I felt like having my media of the week series on my personal website felt..... way too informal. And I kinda just want a new blank slate to be able to do whatever without having to worry about the site being linked to any totally "professional" services lol. Like I felt weird saying a song was so fucking good while having my personal site have a link to my Linkedin account... likeeeee it just felt weird.

In case you are wondering, I totally stole this branding / name / fucking everything lol from Porter Robinson's side project... of the same name.... yes I blatently ripped it off idrc tho like I'm a fan and $0 are on this website so hahaha.

anyways, heres to more!

## <span class="npf_color_ross">Music</span>

[ALONE by Sam Gellaitry](https://cider.sh/share/song/1706928347)

I'm not going to lie I completely forgot about this EP, so after being reminded I was like... oh yeah this song is pretty good.

[Bunny Is a Rider by Caroline Polachek](https://cider.sh/share/song/1669095607) & [Sunset by Caroline Polachek](https://cider.sh/share/song/1669095781) & [Smoke by Caroline Polachek](https://cider.sh/share/song/1669096183) & [Billions by Caroline Polachek](https://cider.sh/share/song/1669096369)

I've listened to this album so many times I've just been forgetting to add these to my playlist LOL, but yes love.

[Sweet Life by Frank Ocean](https://cider.sh/share/song/1440766146) & [Pilot Jones by Frank Ocean](https://cider.sh/share/song/1440766420)

Okay... call me a fake fan but, I've only just recently listened to channel ORANGE in full, and like yessss love these ones were so good.

[Skater by Four Tet](https://cider.sh/share/song/1729586223)

This song just popped up in my mind recently and like, hell yeah that's gotta go on the playlist the fuck??? Anyways love the like guitar line its so groovy.

[Flop by bassvictim](https://cider.sh/share/song/1742113798)

Irl oomf kate put me on, thanks!!!!! It's a fun one!!! Love

[Flesh without Bloode by Grimes](https://cider.sh/share/song/1051023732) & [Kill V. Maim by Grimes](https://cider.sh/share/song/1051023735)

Ok, I only listened to Art Angels recently and HONESTLY... I didn't like it that much. These two are great, but like some other songs (CAUGH CAUGH CALIFORNIA) did not hit, and at some point I just turned the album off and gave up.... but these two love!

[Kool FM by Four Tet](https://cider.sh/share/song/1283920422)

[Wyatt](https://gb.opn.haus) was showing me Four Tet live vids or something and this one hitttttt love.

[Perfume by Roy Blair](https://cider.sh/share/song/1316794597)

Been on a Roy Blair kick lately with his new album, but this one from his debut (2017!!) is a good one, takes me back... #CheckeredVans days.

### [Next Song Starts by MinimusNoah](https://cider.sh/share/album/l.VhkH5vB)

I think this is one of the best ambient projects of our generation, like for sure. It's full, it's beautiful, it's exciting, it's just great. It feels like everything I want an ambient project to be like. Walking outside in warm temperatures with this in my AirPods is another just another wave. You definently can't just listen to one song from this project and feel satisfied, the whole project deserves a listen every time one of these songs come on my playlist.

One I keep coming back to from this project is [Ode to Pwyll](https://cider.sh/share/song/1771912895), someone (me) needs to drop it in da club!!!

### [CHROMAKOPIA by Tyler, The Creator](https://cider.sh/share/album/l.LJ6IZof)

The 8th album from one of my favorite creatives ever, was initially a bit of a let down. With a single like [Noid](https://cider.sh/share/song/1776500455) and the snippets we got of [St. Chroma](https://cider.sh/share/song/1776500453) and [Thought I Was Dead](https://cider.sh/share/song/1776500464), I was expecting an experimental hype as fuck project, Ã  la Cherry Bomb. Instead what we got was a heavily personal and intimite album with some of Tyler's most personal and heart breaking songs.

With this new frame of mind, relistening to this record makes it such a treat. It's a great listen from top to bottom, even if initially I was expecting something completely different, with some of Tyler's best production and writing across his whole career.

Tracks I've loved:

- [Noid](https://cider.sh/share/song/1775074029)
- [Darling, I (feat. Teezo Touchdown)](https://cider.sh/share/song/1776500456)
- [Sticky (feat. GloRilla, Sexyy Red & Lil Wayne)](https://cider.sh/share/song/1776500460)
- [Take Your Mask Off (feat. Daniel Caesar & Latoiya Williams)](https://cider.sh/share/song/1776500462)
- [Thought I Was Dead (feat. ScHoolboy Q & Santigold)](https://cider.sh/share/song/1776500464)

### [Chasing Moving Trains by Roy Blair](https://cider.sh/share/album/l.olKKPp5)

The second album from Roy Blair after ~7 years(!!!) since his debut project. Now, I've only become a fan of his from this album rollout, but I've been loving everything from this project. The production choices on this record from start to finish are so enjoyable to listen to. One of my favs is on the track [Belmont](https://cider.sh/share/song/1770781303) which is "heavily inspired" (Roy's words not mine) by [House full of Time by Guitar](https://cider.sh/share/song/39870029), which is a track I fucking looooooove. Good tracks all around with some crazy production credits if you look into it :D

Absolutely adore:

- [Belmont](https://cider.sh/share/song/1770781303)
- [Amberwood](https://cider.sh/share/song/1770781301)
- [Panavision](https://cider.sh/share/song/1770781483)
- [Strawberry](https://cider.sh/share/song/1770781718)
